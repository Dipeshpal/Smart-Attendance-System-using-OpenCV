# Toto-Smart-Attendance-System

Smart Attendance System is the way to modernized the existing method of marking attendance on register. It helps to reduce complexity of management. Smart Attendance System not only provide record of attendance of student, it uses Machine Learning technique to identify person facial details to mark attendance on database and it can also perform statistical analysis of student data and provide recommendation to student. It is smart because it provide attendance record to student, teacher and admin in digitalize ways.

### What this project is all about?
 This project is all about attendance management sysetm in digitilize ways by using Facial Recognition with the help of Machine Learning.

# Features of Smart Attendance System-
* It provide attendance management system.
* It use mark attendance with user captured photo/image only.
* Admin just have to provide excel sheet in this format ([Click Here](https://github.com/Dipeshpal/Toto-Smart-Attendance-System/blob/master/sv.xlsx) to see the format) to server [Upload excel to server].
* It will download videos and create dataset for training and testing, and create model for it.
* It provide roles to user. Admin, Teacher and Student. Admin can do anything, Teacher can mark attendance and check attendance, Student can check attendance only.
* It let admin to create/update/delete article also.
